# Community
Community is a crowd funding and revenue sharing platform. Using the blockchain,
investors see return on their investments in real time. Community's first application 
on the platform, **new name here**, put artists to be in charge of their concerts and 
shows.

# The Problem
For a moment, pretend that you are a not yet famous singer/song writer.
You are up and coming and your fan base is building.
You decide that to take your career to the next level you are finally going to have that 
live show that your fans have been asking for.
There are offers and promoters that have approached you, but they are asking you to
play for free at some festival - and you know **that is just not fair**. 

So you roll up your sleeves and decide to put on your own show.
In order to have a show for your fans there are some prerequisites that must be met.
## Prerequisites:
1. Venue - a place that your fans can be entertained comfortably
1. Staff - people to check tickets and keep the order
1. Tickets
## Nice to haves:
1. Money for merchandise - you want to sell CDs and t-shirts 
1. Food & Drinks

# Analysis
You have sketched out your problem, now lets see how we can make this concert happen. First of all list out your fixed costs:
## Fixed Costs
1. Venue - $500
1. Staff - 5 people @ $20/hr * 5hrs = $500
1. Merchandise - $300 for
    * 10 t-shirts @ $5/shirt
    * 100 CDs @ $1/CD
    * 5 hats @ $20/hat
1. Food Truck - $400/night

**Fixed Costs: $1700**

## Revenue Projections
1. Tickets - $20/tickets * **100 ticket** = $2000
1. Food Trucks - $8/meal * **50 meals** = $400
1. Merchandise sales
    * 10 t-shirts @ **$15/shirt** = $150
    * 80 CDs @ **$5/CD** = $400
    * 5 hats @ **$30/hat** = $150

**Revenue: $3100**

**Profit: $1400**

# Solution: The Community Platform
## Crowd Funding
The Community platform allows you to fund raise and look for investors. Let's say you cut 
out $1700(your fixed cost) of your revenue and put it up for invests to buy in. That means 
that 54.83% of the revenue will go to your investors.
## Revenue Sharing
We have our revenue projections above, but keep in mind that the actual revenue would be 
different.
* To boost your revenue, the community platform sells your tickets based on demand. The 
price will never lower than a floor threshold you set, and never be higher than the ceiling
you set.
* All vendors at your venue will have a Point of Sale tool where you and your investors will
be paid out in real time. Yes, that means every time someone buys a ticket, 53% goes to your
investors and the rest goes to you. And everytime someone buys a hotdog from the food truck
the same transaction happens.
* To futher bring the fixed costs down, venues, staff and food truck merchants can 
participate in a private rev sharing model. 
## Private Revenue Sharing Model
* As the issuer, you can issue x% of your revenue to any entity with a wallet address. If 
the venue provider thinks your show is going to be a big hit, they might take the risk and
participate in a rev sharing model.
* You can also pay someone a set amount per ticket sold. For example: 0.0005 BTC per ticket 
sold.

# Community: the ticketing platform and secondary market
All tickets issued on the community platform are tracked as digital assets. This means that
a token is created in place of each ticket. During entry, the staff scans the attendee's
Community wallet address and checks on the blockchain to see if that wallet have the token.
Tickets as a digital asset solves two problems for concert goers:
1. **Scams**: Selling a physical ticket to someone can be risky when the two parties are 
co-located in the same geographical area. The ticket has to be mail and the monetary
transaction would have to depend a lot on trust.
1. **Double Spend**: Buying a digital ticket can be risky because you don't know if the
seller have screenshot the ticket before. Then you better get there before they did.
## Revenue from the secondary market
When a users successfully sells their tickets on the Community platform, they will be charged a transaction fee that will contribute the the artist's revenue.
